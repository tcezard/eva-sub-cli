# Overview of Input Files

View our [video tutorial on input files](https://embl-ebi.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9284869a-9f57-43c6-8222-b3aa0158941e).

The eva-sub-cli tool requires the following inputs:

- One or several valid VCF files
- Reference genome in FASTA format
- Completed metadata spreadsheet

Only the metadata file is passed directly to the CLI tool. The VCF and FASTA files should be referenced from the 
metadata file.

In the following sections, we will examine each of these inputs in detail.

## VCF File

A VCF (Variant Call Format) file is a type of file used in bioinformatics to store information about genetic variants.
The EVA requires data files to conform to the official VCF specifications, so that the data can be interpreted 
consistently by other databases and researchers looking to reuse the data. Many tools can be used to generate VCF files,
including [BCFtools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/), [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/), and 
[GATK](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org).

Besides being compliant with the VCF specification, we also require that each VCF file contains the necessary 
evidence linking the variant to its biological source. This evidence can be in the form of sample genotypes or allele frequencies.

Here is an example of how sample genotypes might look like in a VCF file:
```
##fileformat=VCFv4.2
##FORMAT=<ID=GT,Number=1,Type=String,Description="Genotype">
#CHROM  POS ID  REF ALT QUAL    FILTER  INFO    FORMAT  SAMPLE1 SAMPLE2
1   10583   rs58108140  G   A   100 PASS    .   GT  0/1 1/1
```

And here is how allele frequencies would look:
```
##fileformat=VCFv4.2
##INFO=<ID=AF,Number=A,Type=Float,Description="Allele Frequency">
#CHROM  POS ID  REF ALT QUAL    FILTER  INFO
1   10583   rs58108140  G   A   100 PASS    AF=0.25
```

When using the eva-sub-cli tool, VCF files can be either uncompressed or compressed using bgzip or gzip.

For guidance on frequently encountered VCF validation issues and their resolutions, please see [Common VCF errors](common_vcf_errors.md)

## FASTA File

This is the reference genome that your variants were called against, in uncompressed FASTA format. The EVA uses this to
check that the reference alleles are set correctly in the VCF files.

The sequences of the reference genome must be INSDC-registered, which means they are publicly available in one of the archives within the
INSDC consortium: [Genbank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home), or
[DDBJ](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/index-e.html). This ensures the long-term availability of the genome and the 
reusability of your variation data.

## Metadata Spreadsheet

The metadata spreadsheet provides comprehensive contextual information about the dataset, ensuring that each submission
is accompanied by detailed descriptions that facilitate proper understanding and use of the data. Key elements included
in the metadata spreadsheet are analysis and project information, sample information, sequencing methodologies, and
experimental details. While not all fields are required, users are strongly encouraged to provide as much information
as possible to enhance the completeness and usefulness of the metadata.

The spreadsheet is organized into editable tabs, designed for metadata entry, and non-editable helper tabs, which offer
detailed explanations and guidance for each column. Users are required to complete all relevant sections within the
editable tabs. Mandatory fields in each section are indicated in bold to highlight essential information that must be 
provided for a valid submission. Fields highlighted in green indicate an either/or choice. This means you should fill
in the choice most relevant for your submission, but not both.

Below we go through some important details for each of the tabs.

### Submitter Details

This sheet captures basic information about the person or team submitting the data. This includes the lab name and
center, which is the name of the submitting institution or organization and is the name that will be visible once the
project is live on the EVA website.

### Project

The objective of this sheet is to gather general information about the Project. If you are submitting to an existing
project, you can skip the other details and just provide the project accession; the data in this submission will be
added as analyses linked to that project. In case of a new project, please provide the relevant details including 
submitter, submitting center, collaborators, project title, description and publications.

One important column to note is the Hold Date, which is the date until which the data should be kept private. EVA will
release the data automatically after this date. If it is missing, the default value is three days after the date of
submission.

### Statements

This sheet contains statements that the submitter must agree to before submitting data. Please read each
statement carefully and confirm your agreement before submitting.

Additional information about the Access and Benefit-Sharing statement is available in our
[submission FAQs](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/?Help#submissionPanel&link=confirm-data-shared-openly).

NOTE: To use your Webin account, you must also log in to ENA and confirm the Access and
Benefit-Sharing acknowledgement there. [See here](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide/interactive.html).

### Analysis

For EVA, an analysis is a grouping of samples and data files. This sheet allows us to link VCF files to a project and
to other EVA analyses. Additionally, this worksheet contains experimental metadata detailing the methodology of each
analysis. This includes a local path to your reference FASTA file, as described [above](#FASTA-file).

One project can have multiple associated analyses. EVA links analyses to samples and VCF files through the analysis 
alias, which is a shortened identifier you must provide for each analysis.

### Sample

This is where you describe the biological samples used for your analyses. Each row describes one sample and must include
the Analysis Alias to indicate which analysis it belongs to, and "Sample Name in VCF" which is the exact name of the 
sample as it appears in the VCF file. If you are submitting a VCF without sample names (containing only allele frequencies),
then you can omit the "Sample Name in VCF" column.

We accept preregistered samples, which should be provided using BioSamples sample or sampleset accessions. Please
ensure these are publicly accessible, as otherwise EVA will not be able to validate them.

If your samples are not yet accessioned, and are therefore novel, please use the "Novel sample(s)" sections of the
Sample worksheet to have them registered at BioSamples. Make sure to fill in the required fields in bold, including the
BioSample name, title, taxonomy ID, geographic location (chosen from the controlled vocabulary in the drop-down menu),
and collection date (in YYYY-MM-DD format).

### Files

This sheet lists the VCF files in your submission. These should be provided as local paths within your system, so that
the CLI tool can locate them, along with the Analysis Alias which should be associated with each file. Each file should 
be linked to exactly one analysis.
